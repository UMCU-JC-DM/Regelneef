= SPEC-001: Dataset Generation and Distribution Orchestration System
:sectnums:
:toc:


== Background

The healthcare sector is increasingly relying on data-driven research to advance medical knowledge and patient care. To support these efforts, a system is required to orchestrate the generation of structured datasets from a unified data model of healthcare data, where some preprocessing has already taken place. This system will facilitate the secure distribution of these datasets to authorized research environments and ensure that a comprehensive audit trail is maintained for regulatory compliance and transparency.

This system will primarily serve two types of users: data engineers, who are responsible for dataset generation, and academic researchers, who will use the datasets for analysis. Initially, the system will support 10 data engineers and 100 researchers.

== Requirements

*Must Have*
- The system must generate structured datasets from a unified data model of healthcare data, leveraging preprocessed data.
- The system must provide role-based access control, limiting dataset access to authorized users (data engineers and researchers).
- The system must maintain detailed audit trails, including metadata such as:
  - Software versions used for dataset generation.
  - User information (who created the dataset, who accessed it).
  - Timestamps (when the dataset was created, modified, accessed).
  - Purpose of dataset creation and distribution.
  - Dataset distribution logs (where the data was sent, why, and to whom).
- The system must be scalable to handle large datasets.

*Should Have*
- The system should provide an interface for data engineers to manage the dataset generation process.
- The system should support logging and monitoring for operational visibility.

*Could Have*
- The system could integrate with existing data storage solutions.
- The system could support automated notifications when datasets are distributed.

*Won't Have*
- Data encryption is not required at this stage.
