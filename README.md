= SPEC-001: Dataset Generation and Distribution Orchestration System
:sectnums:
:toc:


== Background

The healthcare sector is increasingly relying on data-driven research to advance medical knowledge and patient care.
To support these efforts, a system is required to orchestrate the generation of structured datasets from a unified data model of healthcare data,
where some preprocessing has already taken place. This system will facilitate the secure distribution of these datasets to authorized
research environments and ensure that a comprehensive audit trail is maintained for regulatory compliance and transparency.

This system will primarily serve two types of users: data engineers, who are responsible for dataset generation,
and academic researchers, who will use the datasets for analysis.
Initially, the system will support 10 data engineers and 100 researchers.

== Requirements

*Must Have*
- The system must generate structured datasets from a unified data model of healthcare data, leveraging preprocessed data.
- The system must provide role-based access control, limiting dataset access to authorized users (data engineers and researchers).
- The system must maintain detailed audit trails, including metadata such as:
  - Software versions used for dataset generation.
  - User information (who created the dataset, who accessed it).
  - Timestamps (when the dataset was created, modified, accessed).
  - Purpose of dataset creation and distribution.
  - Dataset distribution logs (where the data was sent, why, and to whom).
- The system must be scalable to handle large datasets.

*Should Have*
- The system should provide an interface for data engineers to manage the dataset generation process.
- The system should support logging and monitoring for operational visibility.

*Could Have*
- The system could integrate with existing data storage solutions.
- The system could support automated notifications when datasets are distributed.

*Won't Have*
- Data encryption is not required at this stage.

== Implementation

=== Step 1: Set Up the Development Environment
- Provision necessary development and staging environments.
- Install required software and libraries (e.g., databases, web frameworks, authentication libraries).

=== Step 2: Build the Data Ingestion and Preprocessing Module
- Integrate with the existing unified data model.
- Implement data retrieval and preprocessing routines.
- Ensure compatibility with the Dataset Generation Engine.

=== Step 3: Develop the Dataset Generation Engine

- Incorporate options for configuring dataset parameters (e.g., filters, aggregation).
- Integrate logging to the Audit Trail Service for every dataset creation event.

=== Step 4: Implement Access Control and Authentication
- Set up user authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth2, JWT).
- Develop role-based access control (RBAC) mechanisms to enforce permissions.
- Integrate with the Dataset Generation Engine and Dataset Distribution Module.

=== Step 5: Develop the Audit Trail and Logging Service
- Create a central logging service to track all system actions.
- Implement logging of dataset creation, access, and distribution events.
- Ensure logs are immutable and securely stored.

=== Step 6: Build the Dataset Distribution Module
